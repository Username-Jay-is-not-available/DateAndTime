The program asks for you to input a valid city. After you enter the city, it prompts you to enter more cities you'd like to compare it to. Once you respond "n" to the prompt or hit 9 total cities, it ask you about the time. The program allows you to use your current time if you wish or you can enter your own time. For the sake of demonstation, I decided to provide a time. 

NOTE: You must enter any cities that are two words without the space. The way file I/O is set up, it will not accept it.

For input and output, it utilizes just your standard terminal. You start the program and then you type in your input and output.
